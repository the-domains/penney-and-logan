Penney and Logan is an art/entertainment based marketing and management company. We are currently focussed on Artist Management, Mark​​eting, Publicity and Social Media Advertising and Content Management.

The principals, Andrew Penney and Carolyn Logan have more years of experience in arts and entertainment than either wish to admit or acknowledge. They have worked in almost every genre and niche in the business. From film to performance art and galleries to grunge, they have been there, done that and sold the t-shirt/ tea towel double pack.​
